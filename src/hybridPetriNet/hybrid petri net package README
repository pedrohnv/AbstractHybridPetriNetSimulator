## Hybrid Petri Net Package

This package contains the Petri net classes and used objects (place, arc, 
transition). Here is all the logic of the Petri net; how it behaves.

Each subpackage contains the fundamentals elements of a Petri net with
the most common elements of a Petri net.

It should be easy enough to extend the fundamental objects to create custom
objects, which can implement a specific logic.

### Packages

#### Places

#### Arcs

#### Transitions

#### PetriNets
Implements the behavior in each iteration of the net.

#### Evolution
Contains global variables, such as time and iteration. It is abstract.

It was the easiest way of the objects knowing the current time or interaction.

#### SimulationRun

This class does the simulation, advancing (and calling) each iteration and
time step.
